# ROS package continuous integration with travis (now supporting Kinetic).

This repository contains a [.travis.yml](https://github.com/felixduvallet/ros-travis-integration/blob/master/.travis.yml)
file for setting up continuous integration (through Travis-CI) for any ROS package.

Improvements & issues are welcome via pull requests and the issue tracker
(while there's not a lot of active development, it is still supported).  If you
find this Travis file helpful, please star this repository!

This repository also contains several example (i.e. trivial) ROS packages that
serve as example packages for Travis to build and test. They also showcase how
to correctly handle dependencies (system and source).

# Installation instructions

To enable Travis continuous integration for your ROS package, first copy these
files to the *root* of your repository:
 - [.travis.yml](https://github.com/felixduvallet/ros-travis-integration/blob/master/.travis.yml): The script that tells Travis CI what to build.
 - [dependencies.rosinstall](https://github.com/felixduvallet/ros-travis-integration/blob/master/dependencies.rosinstall): A wstool-generated list of source dependencies
   (optional). **Update the contents with your packages.**
 - [catkin.options](https://github.com/felixduvallet/ros-travis-integration/blob/master/catkin.options): Contents of this (optional) file are passed as arguments to catkin_make (for example to skip building a package).

Then, log on to travis-ci and turn on continuous integration for the repository:
 - [travis-ci.org](http://travis-ci.org) is free for open-source repositories.
 - [travis-ci.com](http://travis-ci.com) provides the same functionality for private repositories (at a price).

From then on, any push to this repository will trigger a new Travis-ci build.

# About Travis-CI

Travis provides a clean virtual machine for each build. The .travis.yml script
installs ROS, creates a fresh workspace, resolves all given dependencies, and
sets environment variables (devel/setup.bash). Then, it compiles the entire ROS
workspace (ensuring there are no missing dependencies or compilation errors),
and runs any available unit tests. If any of the compilation/test phases fail,
the build is marked as a failure. Otherwise, it's a clean build.

For more information on Travis CI, see their documentation:
http://docs.travis-ci.com/

# Handling Dependencies:

ROS can handle two types of package dependencies specified in the package manifest:

  - system dependencies that can be installed using `rosdep`, including other
    ROS packages and system libraries. These dependencies must be known to
    `rosdistro` and get installed using apt-get.
  - package dependencies that must be checked out from source. These are handled by
    `wstool`, and should be listed in a file named dependencies.rosinstall.

NOTE: **All** dependencies should be handled in one of these fashions; you
should not install packages by modifying the .travis.yml file.  If you are
missing a package, it's most likely that you haven't defined the dependency in
package.xml.

Note that any packages located inside your catkin workspace will take
precendence over the rosdistro system-wide package.
This allows you to use the cutting-edge version of a package directly from
source.

For public builds (i.e. when using travis-ci.org), `wstool` dependencies should
use a *public* access link (for instance, the https github address instead of
ssh). Otherwise you will get a "Permission denied (publickey)" error.

The example package `ros_pkg_with_dependencies` showcases both types of
dependencies: there's a dependency on audio_common_msgs (known to rosdistro), so
that package will get installed using `rosdep`. There is also a public
repository link inside `dependencies.rosinstall`, so Travis will clone the
repository into the workspace before building anything.

When building your own package, make sure to remove the contents of
dependencies.rosinstall and add your package's source dependencies instead.

# Build matrix

The .travis.yml defines a build matrix specifying which combinations of Ubuntu
distribution and ROS version should be used.

Currently, the list of supported pairs is:

 - ROS indigo on Ubuntu trusty
 - ROS kinetic on Ubuntu xenial

Note that some pairs are not possible (e.g. kinetic on trusty or indigo on
xenial). The debian packages must be available for the appropriate ubuntu
release.

# ROS variables:

The .travis.yml file has some [environment
variables](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/) you can
change to customize your build: defined in the script which are used to
parametrize the build:

  - ROSINSTALL_FILE (default is dependencies.rosinstall in repo): This file
    list all necessary repositories in wstool format (see the ros wiki). If the
    file does not exists then nothing happens.
  - CATKIN_OPTIONS (default is catkin.options in repo): File **whose contents**
    specify the options passed to catkin_make. If this file does not exist,
    catkin_make is called without options. For example, you can have catkin
    *not* build several packages by putting this inside the file:

        -DCATKIN_BLACKLIST_PACKAGES=pkg_a;pkg_b

# Private repositories:

Travis-ci.com can build a private repository. However if your package has
dependencies that are also private, you have to go through additional steps.
The instructions are generally listed here:
http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/private-dependencies/

At a high level, you shoud:

1. Create a machine account on github.
2. Generate a public/private key on your computer, if not done already.
3. Add the public key (id_rsa.pub) to the machine account's github settings (see [here](https://developer.github.com/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#machine-users)).
4. In github, make sure the machine account has read access to all the dependency repositories.
5. In github, add the machine account as an administrator for the repository you want to build (note: not the dependencies).
6. In travis settings for the machine user, add the *private* key (id_rsa) in the build job settings.

# The example packages

This repository contain some example packages to:

* Verify this script indeed works
* Give Travis something to do
* Serve as an example of "proper" dependency management

The packages are:

* basic_ros_pkg: Just a simple C++ node.
* ros_pkg_with_tests: Includes both python and C++ tests
* ros_pkg_with_dependencies: Has dependencies in package.xml that must be
  resolved by wstool (in this case, clone pocketsphinx from source) and rosdep
  (in this case, install audio_common_msgs using rosdep).

You can look at the [Travis build
log](https://travis-ci.org/felixduvallet/ros-travis-integration) to see exactly
how it resolves dependencies and then builds the package.
